## 🛠️ The Construction Years

Before leadership, I spent **11 years in the HVAC trade**, working through the ranks to become a **union journeyman** and small-crew foreman.  
Those years taught me:
- **Precision and planning:** Layouts, Trimble laser setups, and AutoCAD translation — every inch mattered.
- **Accountability:** Work had to be right the first time; safety and quality weren’t optional.
- **Resilience:** Long hours, heavy travel, and 3–4 hour daily commutes — but never missed a shift.
- **Team ownership:** Crews worked best when they trusted each other and their lead.

That experience built my foundation: a respect for the people doing the work and the discipline to see things through.

## 🕵️‍♂️ The Asset Protection Shift

When I joined **Walmart Asset Protection**, I learned a different side of operations — the systems that keep everything honest and efficient.

- Developed a sharp eye for **process gaps and root causes** rather than just symptoms.  
- Learned to apply **data with discretion** — not every metric tells the whole story.  
- Reinforced the importance of **fairness**: holding people accountable without losing empathy.

This period honed my investigative mindset and my ability to balance people with policy.

## 💼 The Digital Era — Leadership in Motion

As a **Digital Team Lead**, I took those lessons into leadership.  
Today, I manage a large team in Walmart’s Online Grocery Pickup and Delivery space — a fast-paced, metric-driven environment where success depends on clear systems and trust.

What I focus on:
- **Operational clarity:** turning chaos into repeatable structure (coverage maps, dashboards, KPI tracking).  
- **People-first scheduling:** no clopens, balanced weekends, fair rotations.  
- **Coaching and growth:** guiding associates with respect, not pressure.  
- **Continuous improvement:** refining A2D/S2D, prep and dispense flow, and ATC coordination.

Every process improvement starts with a question — *what’s really slowing us down, and how do we fix it sustainably?*

## ⚓ Leadership Philosophy — The Rising Tide

> *“A rising tide lifts all boats.”*

That phrase defines my leadership.  
When people feel supported, informed, and respected, their performance becomes sustainable — not forced.

My job is to create **current**: clear expectations, solid systems, and honest communication that carry everyone forward — from new hires to veterans, from metrics to morale.

## 🔥 Outside the Shift

Off the clock, I’m still a builder — just in different worlds.  
I spend my downtime forging new ideas:
- Designing **fantasy worlds** and stories with my wife Sunny.  
- Sketching **weapon concepts** and creating lore for our shared RP world.  
- Experimenting with tools, spreadsheets, and systems that make work smarter and life simpler.

**Theorycrafting.life** is my forge — where leadership, creativity, and improvement all meet.
