Understanding your people—their strengths, preferences, and energy—makes all the difference when building schedules that work. The goal isn’t just coverage; it’s putting people where they can thrive.

### The Challenge
Scheduling in a fast-paced environment means finding the right balance between *efficiency* and *engagement.*  
You want the right people in the right roles at the right times—but you also want to keep things varied enough to prevent burnout.

### The Approach
When I first started, I kept it simple.  
I pinned a sheet on the whiteboard and asked each associate to put their name in one of four boxes:

- **Picking**  
- **Dispensing**  
- **Half & Half**  
- **Don’t Care**

I made it clear these were *preferences*, not guarantees, but it gave me a quick visual snapshot of where people naturally performed best—and what they enjoyed.

People tend to work better when they enjoy what they’re doing.

From there, I built a simple Excel tool to help design the backroom board and manage coverage.  
It accounted for:
- **Lunches and peak hours**
- **Forecasted picking demand**
- **Scheduled clock-ins and clock-outs**

This let me match people’s tasks to the forecast in real time, and even schedule lunches so coverage stayed consistent through busy periods.

- Knowing your people is as important as knowing your numbers.  
- Forecast gaps reveal opportunities to cross-train and balance workloads.  
- When preference and performance align, *coverage takes care of itself.*
